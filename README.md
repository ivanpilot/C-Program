# C-Program
Bunch of source code written in C for fun

The following is some source code that I have written myself for fun and to learn more about C programing. 
It includes some algorithm to detect if a credit / debit card is a valid one.
It also include some code of a famous and well know old game (paddle + ball to break bricks)
and many other stuff
So have fun yourself!
